## 0.1.2 (2026-09-30)

### 🚀 Features

- `<section-list>` draws a separator at each edge of a section, as `SectionSeparatorComponent` does. ([#23](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/23))
  `<ng-template sectionEdgeSeparator>` is drawn between a section's header and its first item and
  between its last item and its footer, and is told the section and the sections either side. It used
  to be missing, and the documentation said to draw one inside the header or footer template instead.


### 🩹 Fixes

- `DeepLinks` delivers the url an app was launched with to every `subscribe()` listener rather than ([#24](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/24))
  only the last one to subscribe, and one listener stopping no longer stops it reaching the others.
  An app that subscribed alongside the router took the launch link from it, and one that subscribed
  and stopped before the url was known left the router never following it.

- `DeepLinks` delivers the launch url to each `subscribe()` separately. A listener that throws is ([#28](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/28))
  reported to Angular's `ErrorHandler` and no longer keeps the launch url from the listeners after
  it, such as the router's. The same function subscribed twice keeps getting the launch url until
  both subscriptions stop, not just one.

- `nx g @ng-native/nx:app` and `ng add @ng-native/schematics` now install `expo` `~57.0.26`, the current SDK 57 release, as `npx expo install --check` expects, and the starter template matches. ([#31](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/31))
- `FileSystem.cache()` and `FileSystem.document()` now throw `[angular-native] expo-file-system is not installed` on the web and in a test with no fake source, as documented, instead of a `TypeError` about `cacheDirectory` or `documentDirectory`. ([#20](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/20), [#13](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/issues/13))
- `nx g @ng-native/nx:app` and `ng add @ng-native/schematics` now install `expo-system-ui` with the app, as the starter template does, so the app's `userInterfaceStyle` applies on Android. ([#20](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/20), [#13](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/issues/13))
- `StatusBar` changes the bar again in an app built with the iOS 27 SDK, where UIKit ignores the app-wide setters React Native's status bar module calls. `@ng-native/metro`'s config plugin now answers those calls from the view controllers iOS asks, the window's root and a screen or React Native modal presented full screen, and sets `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance`. `expo-status-bar` and React Native's own `StatusBar` work again too. Until the app claims a style or visibility, a screen's own `statusBarStyle` and `statusBarHidden` apply. An existing app picks it up with `npx expo prebuild --clean`. ([#32](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/32))
- `@ng-native/metro` is also an Expo config plugin, `"plugins": ["@ng-native/metro"]`, and the ([#22](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/22))
  template and both generators add it. It adopts the UIKit scene life cycle in the `AppDelegate.swift`
  that `expo prebuild` writes, since an app built with the iOS 27 SDK that does not exits at launch
  with "UIScene life cycle is required for apps built with this SDK". React Native now starts from a
  scene delegate, which hands the links the app is opened with and receives, and its life cycle
  events, on to `AppDelegate`, so Expo's modules and code added there see them as before. What
  another plugin adds among the lines it replaces, as `@react-native-firebase/app` does, stays. For
  an app made before this release, add `"plugins": ["@ng-native/metro"]` to `app.json` and run
  `npx expo prebuild --clean`.

- A `StatusBar` claim pushed before the app's first `set()` stays on top. `set()` used to replace ([#19](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/19))
  whatever was first on the stack, so a screen that pushed before startup code set the base lost its
  style, and dropping it later restored nothing.

- `StatusBar.set()` and `push()` no longer subscribe the caller to the bar's own state. An app that set its base style in an `effect` had that effect run again on every later `set()` or `push()`, which wrote the base back over what was just set. ([#33](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/33))
- A `SecureStorage` signal whose first read fails, such as a keychain the app has no entitlement for, ([#17](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/17))
  keeps its default and reports the failure on `error`, as a failed asynchronous read already did.
  It used to throw from `signal()`, so the component asking for it was never created and its screen
  rendered blank.

- The starter template now includes expo-system-ui, so its dark userInterfaceStyle applies on Android in development and release builds instead of being ignored. ([#12](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/12))

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-29)

### 🩹 Fixes

- An app from `ng add @ng-native/schematics` or `nx g @ng-native/nx:app` starts without warnings. ([#5](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/5))
  Its `app.json` sets the router root, as the template's does, so Expo no longer prints "Using
  src/app as the root directory for Expo Router". In Nx, the app's `start` target runs `expo start`
  itself rather than through `@nx/expo:start`, whose deprecation notice Nx printed on every
  `nx start`, and `nx add @ng-native/nx` adds Babel 7's `@babel/runtime` at the root, so Metro no
  longer warns about `@babel/runtime/regenerator` in an `@nx/angular` workspace. For an app made
  before this release, add `"extra": { "router": { "root": "src/app" } }` to its `app.json`; in Nx,
  also add a `start` target running `expo start` in the app's directory and `@babel/runtime@^7.20.0`
  to the root `devDependencies`.

- The template targets iOS and Android only. ([#5](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/pull/5))
  Its `app.json` names both as its `platforms`, and the web favicon, its `web` settings and
  `web-build/` in `.gitignore` are gone. The Angular CLI and Nx generators name the same platforms.
  Angular Native components render in a browser through `@ng-native/web`, which is set up
  separately.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-29)

### 🚀 Features

- The first public release: Angular components as real native iOS and Android views, in an Expo app. ([8803fb6](https://github.com/ng-native/ng-native/commit/8803fb6))
  Angular Native is built on Expo and React Native's Fabric renderer, so an app is created, run, hot
  reloaded, built and shipped with the Expo tooling you already know, and Expo's modules - the photo
  picker, location, Face ID and fingerprint, sign-in through the system browser, pictures from the
  camera view, notifications, secure storage and the rest - are available as Angular services and
  directives. Alongside that: a CSS engine that compiles stylesheets and Tailwind at build time, a
  native stack and tab router over `@angular/router`, Signal Forms support, device services, and a
  testing library that runs components in Node against a fake Fabric.
