# Releasing

Every package in `nx.json`'s `release.projects`, and the starter template, is released together at
one version. `.github/workflows/release.yml` does it, run by hand from the Actions tab on `main`.

## Once, before the first release

1. **Own the npm scope.** Create the `ng-native` organization on npmjs.com. Every package publishes
   as `@ng-native/*`, and a publish to a scope you do not own fails.
2. **Publish a placeholder of each package.** npm only lets a trusted publisher be configured on a
   package that already exists, so each one first went out by hand as an empty `0.0.1`.
3. **Configure trusted publishing** on each package's settings page on npmjs.com: GitHub Actions,
   organization `ng-native`, repository `ng-native`, workflow `release.yml`. The release publishes
   through OIDC and no npm token is stored anywhere. The first release must be above `0.0.1`:
   `0.1.0`, or a `minor` bump.

## Describing changes

A change someone using the packages would notice comes with a **version plan**: a markdown file
in `.nx/version-plans/` saying what changed and how big a bump it is. `npx nx release plan` writes
one interactively, or write it by hand:

```md
---
__default__: minor
---

A virtual list recycles its rows when a template tracks them by slot.
```

`__default__` covers every package, which is right while they are released in lockstep. `minor` is
the bump for a breaking change under `0.x`, and `patch` for anything else. Each release turns the
plans it finds into its `CHANGELOG.md` entry and deletes them, so the changelog says what the
plans said, not what the commit messages did. Refactors, tests and docs need no plan.

## Each release

Run **Release** from the Actions tab, on `main`, once CI is green there. Its input is either an exact
version (`0.1.0` for the first) or a bump. Releases are plain `0.x` versions on npm's `latest` tag,
which is what `create-expo-app --template @ng-native/template` resolves: `minor` for a release with
a breaking change, since under `0.x` a minor is the breaking bump, and `patch` otherwise.

The workflow first builds the canary natively for iOS and Android (`native.yml`). Each release build
is then launched, iOS on a simulator and Android on an emulator, and driven through a short Maestro
flow (`examples/canary/.maestro/release`), so an app that builds but crashes at launch fails there,
as it does on every pull request. Beside it, the
`generators` job adds a native app to a fresh `ng new` workspace with `ng add @ng-native/schematics`,
and to a fresh Nx `angular-monorepo` workspace with `nx add @ng-native/nx`, and tests and bundles
each, installing with npm. Once all of those pass, it runs the same gate CI does, then:

- `nx release version` writes the version to every package and the template, and
  `nx release changelog` turns the version plans into the `CHANGELOG.md` entry, then commits both
  as `Release <version>` and tags it `v<version>`.
- `nx run-many -t build` compiles each Angular package into its `dist`: partial-compiled
  JavaScript and declarations, which its `publishConfig.exports` point at.
- `pnpm pack` turns each `workspace:*` dependency into that exact version, and `npm publish`
  publishes each tarball with provenance, on `latest`. A version with a prerelease suffix
  (`0.2.0-rc.0`) would go out under that suffix's dist-tag instead, so `latest` never moves to it.
- The commit and tag are pushed, and a GitHub release is created with the changelog entry as its
  notes.
- The documentation site is built from the tag and deployed to production (`docs.yml`), so
  ng-native.com documents what is on npm, not what is on `main`. A documentation-only fix can go
  live sooner by running **Docs** by hand on `main`.

If it fails before publishing, nothing has left the runner: fix it and run it again. If it fails part
way through publishing, run it again with the same exact version (not a bump): packages already on
npm at that version are skipped, and the rest are published.

## Checking distribution locally

`node scripts/verify-publish.mjs` publishes everything to a local Verdaccio, generates an app with
`create-expo-app --template @ng-native/template`, and bundles it. With `--web` it also sets up a
browser app on `@ng-native/web` as its documentation page does, builds it with Vite and checks it in
Chromium. CI runs both on every push. With `--generators` it also runs the two workspace checks
above, which take several minutes, so only the release workflow does. `--scenario=web` runs the
browser check alone. The README has the local steps.

## The weekly check against the newest versions

This repository pins its dependencies, and a user's new workspace installs the newest versions our
ranges allow, so the two drift apart between releases: Angular 22.2 crashed every new app on Hermes
while the tests here still ran 22.1.5. `.github/workflows/latest.yml` runs every Monday, and by hand
from the Actions tab, to catch that within a week. Each job runs one scenario of
`node scripts/verify-publish.mjs --scenario=<name>`: the template with npm and with pnpm, `ng new`
with `ng add`, Nx's `angular-monorepo` preset with npm and with pnpm, and its TypeScript preset
with npm. Each Nx one also generates a library the app renders and tests, and every scenario runs
its install a second time and bundles for iOS and Android. The job summary lists the Angular, Expo,
React Native, Nx, Vitest and TypeScript each scenario resolved. A scheduled failure opens an issue
titled `Latest versions: <scenario> fails`, or comments on the one already open; close it once
the fix is in.
