/**
 * `.md` as a module, rendered at build time.
 *
 * The site's prose is markdown because prose is easier to write and to diff as markdown, but a
 * page here is not only prose: a component page interleaves paragraphs with live examples and
 * with API tables, and both of those are Angular components that have to be instantiated, not
 * strings that can be pasted into `innerHTML`. Angular will not compile components out of a
 * string it is handed at runtime, so a page cannot be one blob of HTML with component tags
 * scattered through it.
 *
 * So a markdown file compiles to a *list of blocks* rather than to one string. A line reading
 *
 *     <!-- example: button-variants -->
 *
 * ends the prose block before it and stands as a block of its own, and `doc-content` renders the
 * prose ones with `[innerHTML]` and mounts the example ones as islands. The marker is an HTML
 * comment on purpose: a markdown file with these in it still renders correctly in an editor
 * preview and on GitHub, so a page reads the same in an editor as it does on the site.
 *
 * Highlighting is Shiki, run here rather than in the browser, so no highlighter ships to the
 * client. `defaultColor: false` makes it emit both palettes as custom properties on every token
 * and lets one CSS rule pick between them, which is what makes the theme toggle instant instead
 * of a re-highlight of every block on the page.
