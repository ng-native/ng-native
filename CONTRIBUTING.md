# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`); the packages require at least the `engines.node` floor in `package.json`,
  `>=22.18`.
- pnpm, pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json` (currently `pnpm@10.28.1`). Enable it with
  `corepack enable` if you do not already have it. npm is not supported in this workspace - the
  packages resolve through pnpm workspace links.

## Getting set up

```sh
pnpm install
```

Nx sits on top of pnpm workspaces for task running, caching, and module-boundary enforcement, so
run these through the root scripts rather than calling the underlying tools directly:

```sh
pnpm lint          # boundaries and complexity, through Nx so the project graph exists
pnpm typecheck      # every project, against its own tsconfig
pnpm test           # the full seam against a fake Fabric, no simulator
pnpm coverage       # same, with a 95% coverage floor enforced
pnpm format         # prettier --write .
pnpm format:check   # prettier --check ., what CI runs
pnpm affected       # lint, typecheck and test for what a change can have broken
pnpm export         # a release bundle of every example for iOS and Android, one at a time
```

Lint must go through `nx run-many -t lint` (what `pnpm lint` does): `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`
needs the project graph and silently enforces nothing without it, so running `eslint` bare will not
catch a boundary violation.

Run `pnpm export` after changing the CSS engine, the Metro transform or an example's styles. A
release bundle compiles every component in the app, lazily loaded screens included, so it fails on
any rule the compiler refuses.

A package resolves only what it declares: there is no hoisted root that answers everything, so an
import a package forgot to declare fails here rather than on someone else's machine.
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` pins the React Native native modules with `overrides`, because a native
module has to exist exactly once in a build: a second copy of Reanimated is a second copy of its
native side, and it silently does nothing. The versions are the ones Expo SDK 57 bundles, which
`npx expo install --check` verifies.

A package with React Native among its dependencies declares `@babel/core` 7 as a devDependency,
and one with Nx declares `typescript`. pnpm installs a peer that a package leaves undeclared at the
newest version anywhere in the workspace, whatever range the peer asks for, so the next change to
the lockfile would move React Native onto the Babel 8 that `@angular/compiler-cli` brings, and Nx
onto TypeScript 7. `workspace-peers.test.ts` checks it.

## Running the app and the docs site

```sh
pnpm --filter canary start     # the canary, in Expo Go or a simulator
pnpm --filter documentation dev  # the documentation site, on http://localhost:5201
```

## Where tests live

- `packages/integration-tests` mounts real components through the adapter onto a fake Fabric, so it
  exercises the whole seam (renderer, CSS engine, router, forms) rather than one package in
  isolation.
- `packages/web` has its own suites: a `node:test` suite in `src/`, and a browser suite under
  Vitest (`pnpm --filter @ng-native/web test:browser`).
- `packages/testing` has tests of its own, for the fake Fabric and the Testing Library layer it
  ships to everyone else.

`packages/nx` and `packages/schematics` carry `*.test.ts` files next to the source they test. Every
package not named here has no tests of its own: `packages/integration-tests` covers it.

## CSS engine changes are test-first

The CSS engine does not fail the build on what it cannot express: an unsupported declaration is
dropped with a build warning, and a regression in the engine can drop one with no warning at all.
Write the test that pins down the expected behavior before changing
`packages/fabric`'s or `packages/metro`'s CSS code, and keep coverage high there - that is what
catches a regression this engine would otherwise hide.

Every Tailwind utility is checked too. `tailwind-sweep.test.ts` builds a stylesheet from every
utility Tailwind lists (a spread of the values of a scale, all of a handful), arbitrary values, the
values of an app's own theme (`fixtures/tailwind-sweep-theme.css`), `!`, every variant, the pairs
of utilities that build one value together (found from the CSS: one sets a `--tw-*` property the
other reads, or sets again one the other sets and reads) and a shorthand beside each of its sides,
and holds each case to:

- the build does not throw, and the case either takes effect or is refused with a warning;
- what it commits is a prop React Native declares, with a keyword it takes;
- what it resolves to agrees with what Chrome computes, on iOS and on the web host (the web preset
  and `@ng-native/web`'s reset); and each variant probe agrees again on Android, in dark mode, at
  two more widths and with every state an attribute sets, with the `android:` pairs on Android;
- what a view hands down to a text inside it agrees too;
- its transform comes to the matrix Chrome's does, and its animation paints what Chrome's does at
  points through its first cycle;
- its layout, by Yoga configured as React Native configures it, lands where the web host puts it;
- the module Metro writes holds exactly the sheet checked.

A difference that is a design decision, a known gap or Yoga's own behaviour is listed in the test
with its reason, and the test fails when one stops happening. Two fixtures record what it compares
against:

```sh
cd packages/integration-tests
pnpm tailwind-oracle                                   # Chrome's answers, after a Tailwind upgrade
TAILWIND_SWEEP_UPDATE=1 node --import ./register-linker.mjs --test tailwind-sweep.test.ts
```

Read the diff of the second before committing it: each line is a utility that is refused
differently.

What the sweep reads as props, the canary's Tailwind screen draws.
`examples/canary/.maestro/ios/visual/tailwind.yaml` compares it with a screenshot (`pnpm e2e:ios` in
`examples/canary`, against a release build; `pnpm e2e:ios:record` takes a new one), and the Android
release smoke opens it in CI. `pnpm bench:tailwind` in `packages/integration-tests` times a screen
of Tailwind cards through the engine.

## Writing Markdown

[`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) says where a Markdown file goes (`docs/`, the documentation site
or a package README) and what a page needs: front matter, headings, links and code fences.

## Architecture rules

[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) lists the rules the design depends on (AOT only, zoneless
only, no `@angular/platform-browser` bootstrap, the engine never importing Angular or React Native,
and more). Each one is load-bearing - breaking it does not degrade the architecture, it invalidates
it - so a change that would cross one of these needs a different approach, not an exception.

## Checking distribution locally

Before a change that touches packaging, exports, or the release workflow, verify publishing works
end to end without touching npmjs.com:

```sh
npx verdaccio --config verdaccio.yaml   # a local registry, in one terminal
npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873   # once: publishing needs a user, any name will do
node scripts/verify-publish.mjs         # publish, generate an app, bundle it
```

It publishes every package and the starter template to that registry, runs
`create-expo-app --template @ng-native/template`, installs from the registry so the packages
find each other **by version** rather than through workspace links, then typechecks and bundles the
result. Nothing reaches npmjs, and the registry has no uplink for `@ng-native/*` so a package
that failed to publish cannot be quietly satisfied by the real one.

See [RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md) for how an actual release goes out.

## Pull requests

- CI must be green.
- Describe why the change is needed, not just what changed - the diff already says what.
- A change someone using the packages would notice comes with a version plan in
  `.nx/version-plans/` - `npx nx release plan` writes one. The release's `CHANGELOG.md` entry is
  made from them; see [RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md#describing-changes).
- Commit messages here are sentence-case summaries of the change, often followed by a body
  explaining why (see `git log --oneline -20` for the style); there is no conventional-commits
  prefix convention (`feat:`, `fix:`, and so on) in use.
