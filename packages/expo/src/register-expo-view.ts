/**
 * Expo's native views, driven directly.
 *
 * An Expo module that renders something registers a Fabric component whose name it derives
 * rather than declares, and `requireNativeViewManager` is the only place that derivation is
 * written down. Everything else that function does is React: it caches a host component, builds
 * a view config for React's renderer, and wraps the result in a class whose whole job is to hold
 * a ref. None of that is reachable without React, and none of it is needed - the engine writes
 * props onto the shadow node itself, and Expo's Fabric views take their props as an untyped map,
 * so there is no codegen'd prop list to satisfy.
 *
 * What is left is the name. That is what this package is.
 *
 * No decorators and no Angular here on purpose: this is a registration, and the components it
 * registers are ordinary elements in a template.
