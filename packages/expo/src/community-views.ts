/**
 * Native views from the libraries an Expo app already reaches for, by element name.
 *
 * These are not Expo modules, so their Fabric names are their own - what codegen produced from
 * each library's spec - rather than the `ViewManagerAdapter_` names `registerExpoView` derives.
 * They are here because they are in Expo's own bundled module list, which is the list an app
 * actually installs from, and because the alternative is every app looking each name up in a
 * library's generated code.
 *
 * Names and defaults, not components. An Angular component per native view, prop for prop, is a
 * maintenance burden with no end and a second place for every prop to be wrong. An app writes the
 * small component for the one it uses - a selector, and an input per prop it binds, passed through
 * as a host binding - which keeps its template checked; see `ExpoImage` for the shape.
 *
 * A library still has to be installed for its element to commit as anything. This is the
 * JavaScript half; an element whose native side is missing commits as `UnimplementedNativeView`.
