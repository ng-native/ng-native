# @ng-native/fabric

The framework-agnostic engine underneath Angular Native: a retained view tree, a commit step into
React Native's Fabric, and a CSS engine with a real cascade. No `@angular/core` import anywhere in
it - that boundary is enforced by lint, not just convention.

Alpha: APIs may change before 1.0.

## Install

Most apps never depend on this directly; `@ng-native/platform` and `@ng-native/components` pull it
in. Install it explicitly only to call `nativePlatform()` or `registerViewName()` yourself:

```sh
npm install @ng-native/fabric
```

## Example

Registering a third-party Fabric component that ships no Angular bindings of its own:

```ts
import { registerViewName } from '@ng-native/fabric';

registerViewName('rns-screen', 'RNSScreen');
```

Reading the platform in a component that needs to answer differently per platform:

```ts
import { nativePlatform } from '@ng-native/fabric';

const platform = nativePlatform(); // 'ios' | 'android'
```

## What's in the package

- `getFabricUIManager()` - reads `global.nativeFabricUIManager`, passed to `mount()`.
- `registerViewName()` / `registerPlatformComponents()` - map element and third-party component
  names onto Fabric's native components.
- `nativePlatform()` - the current platform, without importing `react-native`'s `Platform`.
- The CSS engine that `@ng-native/metro` compiles component styles for, and that
  `@ng-native/tailwind` compiles utility classes for.
