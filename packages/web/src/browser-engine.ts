 *
 * `topLoad` and `topError` are deliberately *not* here, though an `<image>` binds both. A

 * and dispatches a real DOM `load` or `error` on the element - which means there is a genuine DOM

     * `metaKey` off it and calls `preventDefault` itself. Returning `false` from a binding
     * prevents the default, as it does in any Angular app.
     *
     * Delivered only to this node's own listeners rather than through `propagate`, and that is
     * the subtle half. `propagate` walks this package's retained tree to emulate the bubbling
     * React Native does in JavaScript. The DOM already bubbles, so a click on a child arrives at
     * an ancestor's listener by itself, and running both would call every ancestor handler twice.
