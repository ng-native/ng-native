/**
 * The device capabilities, answered by the browser.
 *
 * `@ng-native/device` reaches React Native for these, and its factories all fall back to
 * doing nothing off a device - which is what makes that package importable by a test suite, and
 * what made it quietly wrong here. Nothing was provided in place of the fallbacks, so on the web
 * `Screen` reported a window of **zero by zero**, permanently.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic gap. `Screen.compact()` is `width < 768`, so every component that
 * branches on it took the phone tree: the sidebar rendered its mobile sheet instead of its rail
 * in a 1200pt browser window. `anchored-overlay.ts` clamps a popover against `screen.window()`,
 * so every anchored overlay was being fitted into a zero-sized screen. Neither failed loudly.
 *
 * Found by opening the gallery rather than by reading, and it could only have been found that
 * way: jsdom reports a window too, and the tests that mount through `mount` never asked what
 * size it was.

 * Unlike the native source this one really can change: `dir` is an attribute, and an app with a

 * right rather than waiting for a refresh.

 * hosting a second document - an iframe, or the jsdom the tests mount into - observes with its
 * own. `Window` alone does not declare the constructor; `document.defaultView` already has this
