/**
 * The retained node this package hands Angular as `ElementRef.nativeElement`, and the thing every
 * `HostEngine` method actually operates on.
 *
 * `packages/fabric/src/engine.ts`'s `EngineNode` is not reusable here (its constructor-free shape
 * still carries Fabric-only bookkeeping - `committed`, `styleCache`, `sheet`...), but the shared
 * packages never ask for that: they ask for `HostNode`'s five fields, plus whatever a component
 * reads directly off `this.node` after `inject(ElementRef).nativeElement as EngineNode` casts it
 * back. Grepping every such read (`view-base.ts`, `pressable.ts`'s `TouchableBase`, `scroll-view.ts`,
 * `select.ts`'s `textOf`) turns up exactly `kind`, `props`, `text`, `children` and `parent` - so a
 * class that implements `HostNode` honestly, backed by a real DOM node, satisfies every one of
 * them without a cast.
 *
 * `children`/`parent` are maintained by hand rather than read live off the DOM (`el.parentElement`,
 * `el.childNodes`) for the same reason `Engine` keeps its own tree: a live DOM walk would have to
 * filter out nodes this package did not create (there are none today, but a consumer's own
 * `document.createElement` inside a projected template is not this package's to assume against),
 * and `select.ts`'s `textOf` recursion wants exactly the nodes Angular put here, in order.
