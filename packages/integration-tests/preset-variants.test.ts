/**
 * The two presets, built by the real Tailwind CLI.
 *
 * `native.css` and `web.css` share `shared.css` and differ on four variants, and neither the
 * sharing nor the differing was covered by anything: `tailwind.test.ts` reads a checked-in fixture
 * of CLI output rather than invoking the CLI, so an `@import` that does not resolve, or a variant
 * that silently stops being redefined, would have compiled to nothing and failed no test.
 *
 * That matters more than usual here. A variant Tailwind does not know is a build error, but a
 * variant redefined *wrongly* is not: `hover:` pointing at a selector nothing ever matches emits
 * a rule that is simply never true, which is this project's most-repeated failure mode.
