/**
 * The browser differential suite.
 *
 * Every other CSS test asserts a value I worked out by reading the spec, which can only ever be
 * as right as that reading. These assert what Chrome actually does with the same stylesheet and
 * the same tree, recorded once by `scripts/generate-css-oracle.mjs` and committed as a fixture, so
 * the tests stay pure `node --test` with no browser to install.
 *
 * Colours are the probe because `getComputedStyle` reports them in the same `rgb(r, g, b)` form
 * our own compiler emits, so what is compared is which declaration won, not how a value was
 * converted. Regenerate the fixture when adding a case.
