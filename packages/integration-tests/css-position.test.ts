/**
 * `position`, which accepted three values it cannot honour.
 *
 * `position` sits in the compiler's generic keyword list, and that list has no per-property notion
 * of which keywords are real - it takes any identifier and passes it through. Yoga implements
 * `relative`, `absolute` and `static` and nothing else, so `position: fixed` compiled cleanly,
 * committed the string `fixed` to the shadow node, and was ignored by the layout engine. A header
 * written that way simply scrolled away, with no warning anywhere to say why.
 *
 * `sticky` did fail, but by accident rather than by design: lightningcss parses it into a
 * structured value rather than a plain identifier, so the keyword extractor tripped over the shape
 * and reported "expected a keyword", which says nothing about what is wrong or what to do instead.
 *
 * A value this platform cannot express has to be refused where it is written, because there is no
 * console on a device to notice it later.
