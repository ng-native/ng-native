/**
 * The layer between React Native's API and this package's `Source` interfaces.
 *
 * Every capability in `@ng-native/device` is a service reading a `SOURCE` token, and every
 * test of those services provides a fake source - which is what makes the services well covered
 * and left the *default* factories, the ones that actually talk to React Native, almost entirely
 * unrun. That is the wrong half to leave untested. A service's logic is ordinary TypeScript that
 * fails loudly; a source factory is a translation between two APIs, where a wrong property name or
 * a capability detected the wrong way does nothing at all and says nothing about it. The Android
 * dialog bugs lived here: `ActionSheetIOS` is exported on Android with a null module under it, so
 * "is the module there" answered yes and `choose` silently never resolved.
 *
 * `reactNative()` reaches `require('react-native')` through a bare `require` identifier, which in
 * an ES module resolves to a global if one exists. Defining one is therefore the same seam a
 * device gives it, with no production code aware of the test - the alternative would be an
 * override hook that exists only to be overridden.
