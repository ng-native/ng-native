/**
 * The colour text falls back to when it names none.
 *
 * Most text in a themed app never names a colour: labels, titles and prose inherit one, and on the
 * web they inherit it from a base layer that does `body { color: var(--foreground) }`. There is no
 * `body` here, so a theme has to set `color` on the blocks that hold its tokens, or every such
 * element falls back to the initial `color` - opaque black. In light mode that is very nearly
 * right and nobody notices; in dark mode it is black text on a near-black ground, which is what
 * this pins.
 *
 * The whole sheet is built by the real Tailwind CLI and put through the real flatten rather than
 * read off disk, because both steps are load-bearing for the fix and neither is optional:
 *
 *   - the flatten lowers `oklch()` to `rgb()` and unwraps the `@supports` fallback lightningcss
 *     emits around a `var()` holding a wide-gamut colour, which the device compiler refuses;
 *   - `substituteInRules` resolves a `var()` against the declarations of *its own rule*, which is
 *     the entire reason `color: var(--foreground)` can mean one thing inside `:root` and another
 *     inside `.dark`. Written once on `:root` it would resolve to the light value and inherit that
 *     downwards whatever the theme said.
 *
 * Compiling the theme straight from source tests a pipeline that does not exist: it has an
 * `@theme inline` block no CSS parser accepts, and it has had neither of those two passes.
