/**
 * Every Tailwind utility, compiled: see `fixtures/tailwind-sweep.ts` for what the cases are.
 *
 * The cases are built into one stylesheet, as an app that used all of them would be, and that
 * sheet goes through `flattenTailwind` and the compiler as it would in a build. Then, for every
 * case, one of two things must be true:
 *
 * - **It does something.** A compiled rule for it has a declaration, a token or a value settled on
 *   device.
 * - **It says why not.** A build warning names the rule it was written in.
 *
 * A case that does neither is the failure this project fears most: a class that compiles cleanly
 * and does nothing, with nothing to say so. What is refused, and why, is kept as a snapshot, so
 * a change that refuses something new, or stops refusing something, is a diff to read:
 *
