 * spacing scale expressed as `calc(var(--spacing) * n)`. This turns that into the subset a
 * renderer with no CSS parser on device can compile, without changing what any declaration means.
 *
 * The rule of thumb throughout: **anything that is only a browser question is answered here**, at
 * build time, and anything that is a real cascade question is left for the engine, which has a
 * cascade. That is the whole difference from NativeWind, which has to rebuild one.
 *
 * Import `tailwindcss/theme.css` and `tailwindcss/utilities.css` rather than `tailwindcss`, and
 * preflight never arrives - it is `html`, `::before` and `-webkit-*` from end to end. This copes
 * if it does arrive, by dropping what it cannot express, but the warnings are noise nobody needs.

 * whose value is a *string* of further `var()` references that the browser assembles at paint
 * time. That is a CSS parser's job, and there is no parser on device - so the indirection is
 * undone here, back into a gradient whose stops are plain references the engine's own cascade
 * fills in per node. The middle stop disappears on its own wherever no `via-*` class defined it.
 *
 * The direction is read from the same rule, which is where Tailwind puts it, so a sheet with
 * twenty `bg-linear-*` classes keeps twenty different directions.
