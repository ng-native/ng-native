 * Tailwind's CSS, made into CSS the engine's compiler accepts.

 * `@property` declarations, feature detection, pseudo-element resets, `oklch()` colours, and a
 * spacing scale expressed as `calc(var(--spacing) * n)`. This turns that into the subset a
 * renderer with no CSS parser on device can compile, without changing what any declaration means.
 *
 * The rule of thumb throughout: **anything that is only a browser question is answered here**, at
 * build time, and anything that is a real cascade question is left for the engine, which has a
 * cascade. That is the whole difference from NativeWind, which has to rebuild one.
 *
 * Import `tailwindcss/theme.css` and `tailwindcss/utilities.css` rather than `tailwindcss`, and
 * preflight never arrives - it is `html`, `::before` and `-webkit-*` from end to end. This copes
 * if it does arrive, by dropping what it cannot express, but the warnings are noise nobody needs.
